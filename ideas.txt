POSSIBLE IDEAS FOR A FINAL PROJECT:


GAMES:
- Flag game!
    - ID world flags
    - fun facts about flags
        - There will be an option to learn about the origin of the flag
    - analytics
        - Which Continent are you best at?
        - Language?
        - Color?
        - Orientation
        - Time

    - makes you a more worldsy person - edumacational == Z will approve
    - this wouldn't be hard, because we just have to load different images into a canvas-thing
    - GUI-fy
    - Link it to the Olympics somehow -Mamalant 
    
- frogger

- finish wordsearch
    - give it a category & difficulty function
    - put it in the gui

- bughouse (ideally using a web connection)
    - ie, 2 chessboards & sets of pieces
    - where you can use the pieces  that your teammate took
    - I would not be able to test this, 
    - but chesskids would be more than happy to
    - we could include a chat bar
    - option to make the match/matches timed
    - log of moves made
    * I don't reeeallly  want to do this because I'm not that into chess, and kinda stole the idea from Aaron
        - also it would involve something called "Network Architecture" - I learned this term today
        - If we didn't use a web connection, we could re-orient the board each turn. 
        - Also, how do we move objects around if we're doing this in a GUI? Sounds diffic

- Collection of text-based card games (With a computer opponent(I feel like this is not as hard as it sounds))
    - Go Fish

- family feud is still an option but I'm really liking the idea of bughouse
    - I have no idea how this works 

UTILITIES: 
- A bunch of shell scripts?
    - oh wait we're learning Java

- A <physics?> homework-do'er
    - so basically, "enter your values here", with the formulas already entered?

- My mom wants me to make a bee app (she is a beekeeper)
    FOR EACH DAY THAT ONE VISITS HER HIVE:
    - each box has 8 2-sided frames
    - for each frame you want to be able to check off:
        - has eggs
        - has pollen
        - has small larvae
        - has large larvae
            - has "capped brood"
        - has honey (capped/uncapped)
    - area for additional comments, ie:
        - queen cell
        - queen sighting
        - small hive beetle sighting
        - wax moth
        - has drone cells
        - activity level
        - visitors (human)
    - Dropboard (for checking for mites)
        - how many mites
        - graph
    - Feeder
        - ON/OFF
        - how much added
        - auto calculates how much has been drunken
    - "Do next time" with reminders
    - Questions tab
    - Photo
    - Weather
        - overcast?
        - warm? >> Bearding?
        - etc
    - Honey yield
        
MUSIC:
- Another drum machine
    - this time with additive synthesis & ADSR Envelope Generator!

- Music-Maker
