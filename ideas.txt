POSSIBLE IDEAS FOR A FINAL PROJECT:

GAMES:
- frogger
- finish wordsearch
    - give it a category & difficulty function
    - put it in the gui
- bughouse (ideally using a web connection)
    - ie, 2 chessboards & sets of pieces
    - where you can use the pieces  that your teammate took
    - I would not be able to test this, 
    - but chesskids would be more than happy to
    - we could include a chat bar
    - option to make the match/matches timed
    - log of moves made
    * I don't reeeallly  want to do this because I'm not that into chess, and kinda stole the idea from Aaron
        - also it would involve something called "Network Architecture" - I learned this term today

- family feud is still an option but I'm really liking the idea of bughouse

UTILITIES: 
- A bunch of shell scripts?
    - oh wait we're learning Java
- A <physics?> homework-do'er
    - so basically, "enter your values here", with the formulas already entered?

MUSIC:
- Another drum machine
    - this time with additive synthesis & ADSR Envelope Generator!
- Music-Maker
-
